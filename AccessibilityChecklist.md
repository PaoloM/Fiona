## Accessibility checklist

When testing an app for accessibility, there are a lot of things you can do, but the main ones I test for are:

1. __Keyboard navigation__, this includes making sure all parts of the app can be accessed via the keyboard, keyboard shortcuts are a plus as well. The easiest way to test this is to run through the app with the tab & arrow keys. 
1. __Screen reader support__, this requires making sure that all elements/controls have a name for the screen reader. The accessibility insights tool makes it easy to test this (https://accessibilityinsights.io/en/downloads/). 
1. __Color contrast ratios__, the main thing you want to make sure is that controls have the proper color ratios, this can be also be tested using the accessibility insights tool. 
1. __High contrast themes__, this requires checking to make sure that the app displays properly in high contrast themes.
1. __Translations__, I am not sure if translations fit into this, but if they do, I would include checking to make sure the screen reader descriptions are translated as well.
